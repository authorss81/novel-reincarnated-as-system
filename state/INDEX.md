# State index

**Written by the Volume 7 close review fix pass.** `PHASE_SYSTEM.md` §*State Growth* says: *"Keep summaries
compact and bounded… If the continuity files grow too large, create a volume-level index and retrieve only
relevant sections."* `state/` had reached ~2.3 MB across five files and every phase prompt tells the writer to
read `state/current.md` and `state/continuity.md`. **There was no index, so the remedy had never been applied.**

**This is that index, and the first archive pass that goes with it. Nothing was deleted.**

## What the pass did

| File | Before | After (hot) | Archived |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `state/continuity.md` | 913,631 B | 286,993 B | `state/archive/continuity-before-volume-07.md` — 666,949 B of bodies |
| `state/current.md` | 687,607 B | 441,036 B | `state/archive/current-closed-volumes-01-to-06.md` — 283,366 B of bodies |
| `state/chapter-summaries.md` | 503,828 B | 173,259 B | `state/archive/chapter-summaries-volumes-01-to-06.md` — 339,363 B of bodies |

**Hot `state/`, measured after the pass: 1,152,162 B across the five files, was ~2,337,000 B. Archived:
1,292,014 B, all of it verbatim.** Sections moved: **50 of 73** in `continuity.md`, **42 of 69** in `current.md`,
**12 of 20** in `chapter-summaries.md`. **`## ` heading count is unchanged in all three** — 73, 69 and 20, the
69 being the 68 that were there plus the one new section this pass added to `current.md`.

**HOW IT WORKS, AND WHY IT LOSES NOTHING.** Whole `## ` sections were **moved**, not deleted. In the hot file
each one is replaced by a stub that **keeps the original heading line**, so `grep '^## '`, `grep 'Volume 6
close'` and every other search still finds the section where a phase expects to find it, and the stub names
the archive file to read. Every moved byte is in the archive file under its original heading.

**THE RULE A SECTION HAD TO MEET BEFORE IT COULD MOVE.** No kept section of the same file may cross-reference
it — by full heading, by short form, or inside backticks or bold. That was resolved to a fixpoint, so **the
cold-start reading guide in `state/current.md` is still valid as written** and every block it names is still on
the hot file. *Nothing on this pass was moved because it was inconvenient; everything moved because nothing
reads it.*

**ONE HONEST CAVEAT.** Ten blocks moved out of `state/current.md` are named *in passing* inside prose in a kept
section — a sentence like *the block at ch 178 that Volume 4 inherited*. Those are historical allusions in
narrative text, not navigation instructions, **and the stub for each one is still in the hot file under its
original heading**, so the allusion still resolves. **No reading instruction anywhere now points at an archive
file without saying so in the same line.**

**A PHASE THAT WANTS AN ARCHIVED SECTION.** Read the stub, open the archive file it names, read the section by
its heading. **A phase must not re-derive an archived figure from the chapters** — the archive is the record of
what was measured at the time, and re-measuring it will produce a different number.

## Hot file, by section

### `state/current.md` — the position. Read this one first.

| Section | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `## How to read this file` | The cold-start reading order for the whole run. **Still valid as written.** |
| `## Who is where at end of chapter 420` | **THE LIVE POSITION.** ch 420, day 1,090. Every earlier position block is superseded by this one. |
| `## Volume 7 close audit — CLOSED` | The close: fourteen fixed items walked, sixteen findings, the seventeen continuity facts, the protagonist answered in writing, the Volume 8 hand-off. |
| `## Volume 7 close repair order — the sixteen findings, and the phase that must clear them` | **THE BINDING OBLIGATION. Read before planning Volume 8.** File and line of all sixteen, and what must not be touched while clearing them. |
| `## Volume 7 planned`, `## Volume 7 planning — close review repair`, `## Volume 7 Batch 0003 — REVIEW REPAIR` | The plan and two repairs. |
| `## Who is where at end of chapter 404 / 389 / 374 / 360 / 345 / 329 / 313 / 252 / 238` | Kept only because the reading guide names them. Superseded by the ch-420 block. |
| `## Volume 6 close audit — OPENED / CLOSED`, `## Volume 6 close review — REPAIR` | Volume 6's close. The Volume 7 audit cross-references it. |
| `## Volume 5 close audit — CLOSED`, `## Volume 4 close audit — CLOSED`, `## Volume 3 close audit — CLOSED` | Earlier close audits, kept for their preserved-continuity lists. |
| `## What Volume 3 must not do` (both headings), `## Proposed canon changes`, `## Chapter-length decision`, `## Planning traps this file still carries` | Standing bans and decisions. **Still binding.** |
| Everything else | Stub → `state/archive/current-closed-volumes-01-to-06.md` |

### `state/continuity.md` — the rules and the measured facts. Read the head of it.

| Section | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `## World rules` | The nine hard world rules, including the weekday rule and the month rule. **Every phase reads this and it never moves.** |
| `## The layer's rules`, `## Registers`, `## Prose`, `## Content`, `## Named and reserved` | The rest of the spine. |
| `## Established facts (through ch 24)` | The original fact base. |
| `## Volume 7 planned` … `## Volume 7 close — the volume as a whole` | **All sixteen Volume 7 sections**: per-batch established facts, the four running ledgers, the four construction budgets, the batch review repairs, the close, and the volume's full measured figures with the method beside each number. |
| Everything else | Stub → `state/archive/continuity-before-volume-07.md`. This is Volumes 1–6: established facts, running ledgers, construction budgets, batch and close review repairs. |

### `state/chapter-summaries.md` — the per-chapter summaries.

| Section | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `## Rolling volume summary` | **The standing one-paragraph-per-volume summary. Read this instead of the archives.** |
| `## Volumes 5–16` | What is still unwritten. |
| `## Volume 7 planned` … `## Volume 7 closed — audited` | All sixteen Volume 7 sections, chapter by chapter. |
| Everything else | Stub → `state/archive/chapter-summaries-volumes-01-to-06.md`. Per-chapter summaries for Volumes 1–6. |

### `state/open-threads.md` — not archived, and that is deliberate.

**188 KB, entirely live, and it is the file that answers *what is still open*.** It is the shortest of the five
and every block in it is a thread or a standing ban. It was left whole on purpose: archiving it would hide the
open threads, which is the one thing it exists to do. **Volume 7's own threads are the last four sections, at
`## Volume 7 planned`, `## Volume 7 Batch 0001` … `## Volume 7 Batch 0004`, and
`## Volume 7 CLOSED at ch 420 — every thread, measured, and what Volume 8 inherits live`.**

### `state/book-metadata.md` — not archived. 52 KB, twenty-three long lines, all of it current status.

## For the next volume

**Volume 8 planning reads, in this order:** this file · `state/current.md` §*Volume 7 close repair order* ·
`state/current.md` §*Who is where at end of chapter 420* · `state/current.md` §*Volume 7 close audit — CLOSED* ·
`state/continuity.md` §*World rules* · `state/open-threads.md` §*Volume 7 CLOSED at ch 420* ·
`state/chapter-summaries.md` §*Rolling volume summary* · `workspace/volume-07-close/SUMMARY.md`.

**And the repair phase for the sixteen findings comes before all of it.**

## The next time this is needed

`state/` is at ~1.13 MB hot and growing ~40 KB a phase. **At the Volume 8 close, run the same pass**: archive
everything behind the live volume out of `current.md`, `continuity.md` and `chapter-summaries.md` into a new file
under `state/archive/`, leave the stubs, and extend this index. **Do not prune.** `PHASE_SYSTEM.md` gives the
remedy as an index and an archive, not a deletion, and every one of these files is a record of what was measured
at the time it was measured.
